# Travendo - An Ecommerce
## Abstract
Traditional village products had always been very underrated, but the reality is that no urban brand can ever beat the authenticity of village items. 
Travendo aims to provide an Ecommerce platform to small-scale village vendors, comprising traditional village eatables (except for perishables like fruits & vegetables) and many more items. It looks forward to being a go-to place for the urbanites to get high-quality, unadulterated food items at affordable prices. It is a secure and user-friendly platform.
Establishing a platform that provides healthy, unadulterated products and thereby providing an Ecommerce website for small-scale businesses are its key objectives.
Travendo does not just stick to buying and selling, but also in increasing the employment rate in the rural by giving an opportunity to sell <b>“Made in village”</b> items.
